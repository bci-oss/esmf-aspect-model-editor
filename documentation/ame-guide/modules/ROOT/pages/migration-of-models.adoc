[[migration-of-models]]
= Migration of models

There are three different ways to migrate Aspect Model:

* Automatic migration when starting the application.
* Delayed migration in the sidebar.
* Loading an older Syntactic Valid Aspect Model.

[[automatic-migration]]
== Automatic migration when starting the application

As soon as the application is started and an Aspect Models with an older version is found in the workspace.
A dialog appears with the information whether the aspect models want to be migrated.

* If the checkbox Auto-increase namespace versions is activated, the Aspect Models are updated to the next higher version and the old Aspect Models are no longer displayed in the workspace.

* If the checkbox Auto-increase namespace versions is not activated, the Aspect Modes will be overwritten without the version of the Aspect Models increasing.

NOTE: A backup of the old Aspect Models will be created in the workspace as zip package.

After the migration has been completed, the Aspect models can be modelled as usual.

[[delayed-migration]]
== Delayed migration in the sidebar

If the migration of the Aspect Models in the workspace is to be carried out later, this can be cancelled for the first time.
A migration button is provided in the sidebar under Workspace to start this process again.

[[loading-old-model]]
== Loading an older Syntactic Valid Aspect Model

A migration of an Aspect Model in an old version can also be loaded as usual.
The tool automatically recognises the older version and migrates it to the latest BAMM version.
